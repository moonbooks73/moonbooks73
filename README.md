## About me
### I'm Natalia, a Year 12 student, working on my NEA and hoping to improve my programming abilities.
In my spare time I read books on **maths** (I recently read a book on gaming theory), play piano and do Goshin Jiu-jitsu.
I am going to be working for writing coding recipies for a 2 week Reserach placement in meterological science
- Fun fact - Ive been inside 10 Downing Street
